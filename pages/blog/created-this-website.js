        So i've made so many websites such as alot of portfolios in the past but
        this one is special to me because I always wanted a long lasting one!
        Now you might be wondering.. But you said you made many portfolios in
        the past then how is this one so special? Well thats where I tell you
        that those portfolios were none of my liking so I designed this website
        for about a week before cutting a pasting random slices of code to see
        what they did
      </P>

      <P>
        Now lets get into the meat and potatos of this blog post! So I decided
        to use React.js which is a well know javascript web development
        framework, Next.js which is yet another well know{" "}
        <i>Static Site Generator</i>, and Chakra-UI which is a ui library which
        is much more clean and intuitive then basic css or scss. I will go
        in-detail on what I did in the next paragraph.
      </P>

        So I first installed alot of the modules I needed with{" "}
        <b>
          "npm install react next @chakra-ui/react @chakra-ui/icons
          @emotion/styled framer-motion"
        </b>{" "}
        after that I started to work on the home page ofc using my designs as a
        reference. I then made the projects page which took me about a week or
        so because of school. I then created a light/dark theme changer which
        was super simple with chakra. I also added a hamburger menu and worked
        on different port sizes so that the website looks good on all platforms
        i.e. Phones, Tablets, Laptops, PC's, etc. Then I went and worked on the
        blog page and created a few components for intuitivity. And there you
        go... WEBSITE😎
